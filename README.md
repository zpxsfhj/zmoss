This is a Heterogeneous System Architecture : CPU + FPGA. It can be used in Edge Computing,artificial intelligence,etc.
Why is it named zmoss? I want to make a robot like to MOSS of The Wandering Earth.
1.honghu_v1:the FPGA project, it is the Accelerator Card in this Heterogeneous System Architecture
2.honghu_driver: the pcie linux driver of the Accelerator Card
3.zhinao:a application prigram of this Heterogeneous System Architecture
4.doc:some document about this Heterogeneous System Architecture,such as the Architecture of the Accelerator Card
